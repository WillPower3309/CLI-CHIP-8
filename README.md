# CLI-CHIP-8
A CHIP-8 emulator written in C that uses a CLI as its display using the ncurses library. The purpose of this project is twofold:
+ it functions as a cool program that a user can use to play retro chip-8 games in their terminal emulator
+ acts as a minimal and well documented emulator to demonstrate basic emulation concepts to the reader

## Usage
```
./c8 PATH_TO_ROM
```
